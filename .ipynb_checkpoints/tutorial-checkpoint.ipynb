    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are \"a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.\" They allow you to isolate portions of text or numeric data, and do various operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will occur in many contexts across various software, etc Excel, the command-line, Stata, and major programming languages, etc Ruby, Java and C. The principles are for the most part very similar, with minor modifications depending on the platform. We concentrate on the use of regular expressions in Python in this tutorial. "

    "Various characters have special meanings in regular expressions. For instance, \".\" will match any character besides newline. Try it out. \n",
    "\n",

    "Regular expressions also allow you to define sets of characters to allow more customized parsing. The syntax is a set of possible characters within square brackets, etc [a-zA-Z], and quantifers directy after - \"*\" for 0 or more, \"+\" for 1 or more, and \"?\" for 0 or more for how many characters you want from the set.
